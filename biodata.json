My training and experience in the field of computer programming and web design, along with my ability to use consistent coding patterns, collaborate with teammates as well as allow for different thought patterns in solving a problem, make me the perfect candidate for the job. I know that I would be a valuable addition to the team at Viamo.  I have a BSc in Computer Engineering from Obafemi Awolowo University, Ife, and have more than 2 years of experience as a front-end developer. </p><p></p><p>I have good knowledge of VueJs, Laravel/Lumen, tailwind CSS, some DevOps processes, and most recently, laravel-mix, docker, reactjs, and nodejs and outstanding thirst for knowledge that can be translated to excellence in delivery as well as being open-minded to learning from teammates while keeping effective communication.  In my most recent role at Hostville, I was able to build a meeting feature for consultations which helped the product gain more traction as well as a pdf editor used to generate and sign documents as well as generate certificates for tests taken, which improved the overall functionality of the application. </p><p></p><p> I am excited to be applying to Viamo and for the opportunity to contribute better industry-standard codes as well as ideas to help improve the overall chart thereby helping to achieve the company’s goals/vision. I truly admire the vision where all people have access to the information they need to make decisions for healthy, prosperous lives and have meaningful relationships with governments, civil society, and businesses and would feel privileged to be a member of the team at Viamo as this resonates with me.  Please find attached my resume and feel free to contact me directly should you require anything further. </p><p></p><p> Thank you for your time and consideration.
